# Challenge Summary
dealing with arrays and inserting values in them  using Java language 

## Challenge Description
write a function that takes in an array and a value.
add the value to the array, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency
i created a new array with a length greater that the input array by one, 
the looped over the, input array and assigned its values to the new array.
 created another for loop that starts from the last index of the new array and looped until it reached the middle point. in each iteration i assigned the pervious value in the next index.
 finally I set the middle point to equal the input value.
